Configuration / Options:
    //todo: this
Command-line Arguments:
    -c <config file path>
        Force the use of a different config file. "config.json" by default.

        Note: you can list multiple config files at once, like: -c <file1> -c <file2>
        If you do, they will be merged together at the root level, with the later files
        over-riding the options of the previous files.
        This can be useful for defining config files for a specific task, then joining
        then joining together the config files of all tasks you'd like run.

        WARNING: currently the multiple file merge is only a shallow merge.

    -t <target file path>
        Sets the files to be processed.  Targets may be directories or files.
        If a '.json' file is the sole command-line target, it is assumed to be A
        config file with a list of targets.

    -r <CodeReviewer>
        Sets which CodeReviewers will be used.

    -e
        Echo the config file being used.  Useful for trouble-shooting and such.
